### Research Samples

#### Group-wise Inhibition based Feature Regularization for Robust Classification 

![](./fig/group.png)

The convolutional neural network (CNN) is vulnerable to degraded images with even very small variations (e.g. corrupted and adversarial samples). One of the possible reasons is that CNN pays more attention to the most discriminative regions, but ignores the auxiliary features when learning, leading to the lack of feature diversity for final judgment. In our method, we propose to dynamically suppress significant activation values of CNN by group-wise inhibition, but not fixedly or randomly handle them when training. The feature maps with different activation distribution are then processed separately to take the feature independence into account. CNN is finally guided to learn richer discriminative features hierarchically for robust classification according to the proposed regularization. Our method is comprehensively evaluated under multiple settings, including classification against corruptions, adversarial attacks and low data regime. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve signifi- cant improvements in terms of both robustness and generalization performances, when compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

#### Manifold-preserved GANs 

![](./fig/gan.png)

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely adopted in various fields. However, existing GANs generally are not able to preserve the manifold of data space, mainly due to the simple representation of discriminator for the real/generated data. To address such open challenges, this paper proposes Manifold-preserved GANs (MaF-GANs), which generalize Wasserstein GANs into high-dimensional form. Specifically, to improve the representation of data, the discriminator in MaF-GANs is designed to map data into a high-dimensional manifold. Furthermore, to stabilize the training of MaF-GANs, an operation with precise and universal solution for any K-Lipschitz continuity, called Topological Consistency is proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is justified by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. When adopting DCGAN as the backbone on CelebA (256Ã—256), the proposed method achieved 12.43 FID, which outperforms the state-of-the-art model like Realness GAN (23.51 FID) by a large margin.

#### Dynamic Feature Aggregation 

![](./fig/mix.png)

Deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based mod- els are vulnerable to the adversarial attacks. One of the possible reasons is that the embedding space of CNN based model is sparse, resulting in a large space for the generation of adversarial samples. In this study, we propose a method, denoted as Dynamic Feature Aggregation, to compress the embedding space with a novel regularization. Particularly, the convex combination between two samples are regarded as the pivot for aggregation. In the embedding space, the selected samples are guided to be similar to the representation of the pivot. On the other side, to mitigate the trivial solution of such regularization, the last fully-connected layer of the model is replaced by an orthogonal classifier, in which the embedding codes for different classes are processed or- thogonally and separately. With the regularization and orthogonal classifier, a more compact embedding space can be obtained, which accordingly improves the model robust- ness against adversarial attacks. An averaging accuracy of 56.91% is achieved by our method on CIFAR-10 against various attack methods, which significantly surpasses a solid baseline (Mixup) by a margin of 37.31%. More surprisingly, empirical results show that, the proposed method can also achieve the state-of-the-art performance for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, due to the learned com- pact feature space. An F1 score of 0.937 is achieved by the proposed method, when adopting CIFAR-10 as in-distribution (ID) dataset and LSUN as OOD dataset.

#### Point Beyond Class: A Benchmark for Weakly Semi-Supervised Abnormality Localization in Chest X-Rays.

![](./fig/objectdetection.png)

Accurate abnormality localization in chest X-rays (CXR) can benefit the clinical diagnosis of various thoracic diseases. However, the lesion-level annotation can only be performed by experienced radiologists, and it is tedious and time-consuming, thus difficult to acquire. Such a situation results in a difficulty to develop a fully-supervised abnormality localization system for chest X-rays. In this regard, we propose to train the CXR abnormality localization framework via a weakly semi-supervised strategy, termed Point Beyond Class (PBC), which utilizes a small number of fully annotated CXRs with lesion-level bounding boxes and extensive weakly annotated samples by points. Such a point annotation setting can provide weakly instance-level information for abnormality localization with a marginal annotation cost. Particularly, the core idea behind our PCB is to learn a robust and accurate mapping from the point annotations to the bounding boxes against the variance of annotated points. To achieve that, a regularization term, namely multi-point consistency, is proposed, which drives the model to generate the consistent bounding box from different point annotations inside the same abnormality. Furthermore, a self-supervision, termed symmetric consistency, is also proposed to deeply exploit the useful information from the weakly annotated data for abnormality localization. Experimental results on RSNA and VinDr-CXR datasets justify the effectiveness of the proposed method. An improvement of ~5% in mAP can be achieved by our PBC, compared to the current state-of-the-art method (i.e. Point DETR).

#### Fingerprint Presentation Attack Detector Using Global-Local Model

![](./fig/rtkpad.png)

The vulnerability of automated fingerprint recognition systems (AFRSs) to presentation attacks (PAs) promotes the vigorous development of PA detection (PAD) technology. However, PAD methods have been limited by information loss and poor generalization ability, resulting in new PA materials and fingerprint sensors. This article thus proposes a globalâ€“local model-based PAD (RTK-PAD) method to overcome those limitations to some extent. The proposed method consists of three modules, called: 1) the global module; 2) the local module; and 3) the rethinking module. By adopting the cut-out-based global module, a global spoofness score predicted from nonlocal features of the entire fingerprint images can be achieved. While by using the texture in-painting-based local module, a local spoofness score predicted from fingerprint patches is obtained. The two modules are not independent but connected through our proposed rethinking module by localizing two discriminative patches for the local module based on the global spoofness score. Finally, the fusion spoofness score by averaging the global and local spoofness scores is used for PAD. Our experimental results evaluated on LivDet 2017 show that the proposed RTK-PAD can achieve an average classification error (ACE) of 2.28% and a true detection rate (TDR) of 91.19% when the false detection rate (FDR) equals 1.0%, which significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art methods by âˆ¼10% in terms of TDR (91.19% versus 80.74%).
